# Deploy Applications on Cloud Platforms

There are many cloud platform services that allow you to deploy your applications. In this tutorials, I am going to show to how to make your apps go live on the three popular platforms on the market:
- [Google Cloud Platform (GCP)](https://cloud.google.com/)
- [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/)
- [Amazon Web Service (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/)

These platforms provide flexibility for your needs by allowing you to customize your virtual machine and configurations. Infrastructure as a service (IaaS), Platforms as a service (PaaS), and Software as a service (SaaS) are the 3 main types of service available on each platform. In this tutorial, we just focus on IaaS to deploy our applications.
